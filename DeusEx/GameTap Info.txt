        Shifter for Deus Ex
    GameTap Version Instructions
//=================================//

	Shifter can be installed on the GameTap version of Deus Ex, but the
process is not precisely easy.  Fortunately the process requires no special
knowledge, just a little time and patience.


Step 1: Load Deus Ex via GameTap. The game will have to be running while you
	perform some configuration steps.

Step 2: Press "T" to open the chat prompt.

Step 3: Press backspace a few times to remove the word "Say", then type in
	"preferences".

Step 4: Hit enter to bring up the Advanced Preferences window. The game will
	probably drop out of fullscreen mode at this point.

Step 5: Navigate to the following location (click the "+" to expand the
	categories): Advanced -> File System -> Paths -> [0]. "[0]" should not
	have a plus sign next to it.

Step 6: Press the "Insert" button to the far right of "[0]". This will move
	everything down one and create a new, blank "[0]" entry. You will need
	to select "[0]" for the Insert button to appear.

Step 7: Select the new "[0]" and enter the path to a folder on your hard drive
	in the text box. This is just as it would appear (mostly) when viewing
	the files in Windows. I recommend something really, really simple like
	"C:\DeusEx".

Step 8: In that same text box, add "\*.u" to the end of whatever path you
	entered. You should wind up with something like "C:\DeusEx\*.u".

Step 9: Close the Advanced Preferences window by clicking the small "x" in the
	upper right.

Step 10: Exit Deus Ex.

Step 11: Download Shifter and extract the "DeusEx.u" file to the folder you
	 entered in Step 7 (e.g. "C:\DeusEx").

Step 12: Run Deus Ex via GameTap again. Enjoy the Shifter awesomeness.


IMPORTANT NOTE:

	Because you cannot remove or replace the "DeusEx.int" file in the
System directory used by GameTap, some text changes will NOT come through.  The
most important of these is the Alt-Fire option, which will show up in the
keyboard configuration screen as "Put In Hand".  The REAL "Put In Hand" is now
at the bottom of the key list, along with another entry for Alt-Fire.  When in
doubt, scroll to the bottom of they keyboard configuration list to see what key
controls Alternate Fire.
