Shifter, a gameplay modification for Deus Ex
By **yukichigai**

This is a copy of [this](https://code.google.com/p/shifterdx/) repository 

##Overview
>This is a code repository for Shifter, a popular (so I'm told) mod for the PC game Deus Ex. Shifter seeks to address certain issues and shortcomings present in the original game, as well as adding new gameplay mechanics and features. More details are available on the official Shifter webpage.

##Licensing
>While the code I write is released under the Lesser GNU license, much of it is based on or uses code originally created by Ion Storm et al for Deus Ex, due to the nature of the project. That code is not subject to the Lesser GNU (as far as I know), and copyright is still held by Ion Storm, Eidos, or any combination of those and other entities not already named.
